# Monitoring

Mousetrap exposes metrics for you to better monitor the state, performance and file distribution of all files that pass through Mousetrap.

The metrics are exposed on the Prometheus standard `/metrics` route.

You can also use the provided grafana dashboard with the prometheus as the datasource to get a nice overview of mousetrap.
